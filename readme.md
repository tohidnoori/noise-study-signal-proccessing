# Noise Types in Signal Processing
This repository explores different types of noise in signal processing, including their characteristics and frequency domain representations.

## 1. White & Pink Noise 
### White Noise 

White noise contains all frequencies at equal intensity, resulting in a flat frequency spectrum. It is often used for testing and calibration in signal processing.

**When it occurs:** White noise appears in many electronic and natural systems where random signals are present.
**Frequency range:** It spans the entire frequency spectrum with equal power.



### Pink Noise 
Pink noise has equal energy per octave, meaning lower frequencies have more power. It is commonly found in natural systems and audio applications.

**When it occurs:** Found in biological systems, music, and environmental sounds.
**Frequency range:** More power in lower frequencies, decreasing at -3dB per octave.

## 2. Click Noise
Click noise consists of sudden, short-duration impulses. It is typically caused by electrical interference or digital errors.

**When it occurs:** Often due to electrical switching, hardware malfunctions, or digital transmission errors.
**Frequency range:** Wideband frequency spectrum due to short impulse duration.

## 3. Hum Noise
Hum noise usually originates from power line interference (e.g., 50Hz or 60Hz hum). It is caused by electrical systems and grounding issues.

**When it occurs:** Typically due to improper shielding, grounding loops, or power supply interference.
**Frequency range:** 50Hz or 60Hz fundamental with harmonics at multiples of the base frequency.

## 4. Wind Noise
Wind noise is low-frequency noise generated by air turbulence over a microphone or other surfaces. It often occurs in outdoor recordings.

**When it occurs:** Common in outdoor recordings, affecting microphones and sensors.
**Frequency range:** Mostly below 100Hz, with energy decreasing at higher frequencies.
